Mr. Luksic’s companies own other U.S. investment properties, but none in Washington until recently, Mr. Terré said.
A U.S. unit of the Luksic family’s mining company, Antofagasta PLC, is battling the federal government and environmental groups over its proposed Minnesota mine. Part of the project would sit on U.S. Forest Service land adjacent to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, a 1.1 million-acre tract of lakes and forest first protected by the government in 1926. 
The Luksic unit, Twin Metals Minnesota LLC, sued the U.S. government in September in a Minnesota federal court over a preliminary move by the Interior Department to deny renewal of two key mineral leases. Nonetheless, the department in December denied the leases, citing the risk of “serious and irreplaceable harm to this unique, iconic and irreplaceable wilderness area.”
The area of the disputed leases contains “one of the largest untapped copper and nickel resources in the world,” Twin Metals said in a February court filing, “conservatively estimated at more than $40 billion of in-ground mineral value.”
Twin Metals spent $160,000 lobbying Congress on the issue in the second half of 2016, federal records show. A Twin Metals spokesman said the company has asked the Trump administration to reverse the mineral-lease decision.
The proposed mine is opposed by environmental groups and by Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat. It is supported by Minnesota officials of both parties who cite potential job creation.
U.S. Rep. Rick Nolan, a Democrat who represents the area, in a news release attacked the lease decision as “anti-mining, anti-jobs” and in January urged the Trump administration to overturn a related Obama administration move to place a 20-year moratorium on mining in the area.
The Justice Department has asked the court for a 60-day delay in the case to allow “time to brief incoming administration officials” about the matter. “It is something we are actively reviewing,” an Interior Department spokeswoman said.
The 62-year-old Mr. Luksic is chairman of a family-controlled conglomerate and sits on the board of Antofagasta, the family’s mining concern. The family fortune was started in the 1950s with a mining investment by his father, the son of a Croatian immigrant.
In Chile, a bank part-owned by Mr. Luksic’s family has been drawn into a continuing investigation involving a loan to the daughter-in-law of the president, whose popularity has plummeted over the controversy. Chilean bank regulators have said they didn’t find anything improper in the loan, and a spokeswoman for Chile’s attorney general said this week the loan isn’t currently part of the probe and Mr. Luksic isn’t among those being investigated.
Mr. Luksic did meet with the president’s daughter-in-law about the loan but wasn’t personally involved in the decision to grant it and neither he nor the bank did anything wrong, a spokesman for the Luksic holding company said. 
Companies controlled by Mr. Luksic own nine luxury apartments in Boston and two in Miami, according to real-estate records and Mr. Terré.
Mr. Luksic recalls meeting Mr. Trump just once, Mr. Terré said, at a New England Patriots game about four years ago Mr. Luksic attended as a guest of the team’s quarterback.
As for the move into Washington real estate, Mr. Terré said, the company “saw an opportunity” after Mr. Trump’s surprise victory because of turnover among government employees and others wanting to move there.
Mr. Luksic also bought two smaller apartments in an unfinished Washington building for a total of $1.8 million, according to Mr. Terré and property records.
